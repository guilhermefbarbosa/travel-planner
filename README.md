## Travel Planner

:alert: This project is currently in development. 
He will become a travel planner that allows users to save their flights and hotels, write down their itinerary and manage their budget.

The project will be built in multiple languages, frameworks and technologies to allow me to learn new skills:
- The front-end will be built in `React`, `Flutter` and `Kotlin`
- The back-end will be built in `Go`, `C#`, `Python` and `Kotlin`
- Data will be stored in `Postgres`, `MongoDB` and `Redis`

## Project Structure

The project is divided into multiple folders:
- `api`: contains the back-end code, with a sub-folder for each language implementation
- `app`: contains the front-end code, with a sub-folder for each language implementation

Each sub-folder will contain a `README.md` file with instructions on how to run that project part, either back or front-end.
